.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fI\%Neubot\fP is a free\-software Internet bot that gathers network performance
data useful to investigate network neutrality. Neubot runs in the
background and periodically performs active network tests with test
servers provided by \fI\%Measurement Lab\fP (a distributed server platform
that hosts open network measurement tools). Implemented tests are
described in the \fI\%IMPLEMENTED TESTS\fP section.
.sp
Neubot does not perform any network test until you grant it the
permission to collect and publish your IP address for research
purposes. Neubot behaves like this because it is developed in the
European Union, thus it must comply with European privacy laws
(which consider IP addresses personal data). More on privacy
aspects in the \fI\%PRIVACY\fP section.
.sp
Neubot is a background process. You can control it by using its
subcommands, its web interface or its web API (see, respectively,
the \fI\%SUBCOMMANDS\fP, \fI\%WEB INTERFACE\fP and \fI\%WEB API\fP sections). Neubot
listens for web requests at \fBhttp://127.0.0.1:9774/\fP. To access
the web interface, use either your favorite browser or the \fBviewer\fP
subcommand. To change the address and/or port where Neubot listens
for web requests, edit \fB/etc/neubot/api\fP (see the \fI\%FILES\fP
section).
.sp
Neubot runs with the privileges of the \fB_neubot\fP user,
or with the ones of the user indicated in the \fB/etc/neubot/users\fP
configuration file (see the \fI\%FILES\fP section).
.sp
The command line interface allows you to get the usage string
(\fBneubot \-\-help\fP), get the version number (\fBneubot \-V\fP) and
run a Neubot\(aqs subcommand (\fBneubot subcommand...\fP).
.SH IMPLEMENTED TESTS
.sp
All Neubot tests receive and send random data. Also, note that Neubot does
not monitor the user\(aqs traffic.
.sp
Neubot implements three active network tests: \fBbittorrent\fP, \fBraw\fP and
\fBspeedtest\fP. For each test, there is a Neubot subcommand that allows
to run the test immediately. Also, note that Neubot schedules one of the
three tests at random every 23 \- 27 minutes.
.sp
The \fBbittorrent\fP test emulates BitTorrent peer\-wire protocol to
estimate the round\-trip time, the download and the upload goodput.
It uses the time that connect() takes to complete as an estimator of
the round\-trip time. It estimates the goodput by dividing the amount of
transferred bytes by the elapsed time. To avoid consuming too much
user resources, the \fBbittorrent\fP test adapts the number of bytes to
transfer such that the test runs for about five seconds.
.sp
The \fBraw\fP test performs a \fIraw\fP 10\-second TCP download to estimate the
download goodput. Also, it estimates the goodput from the round\-trip time,
and it collects statistics about the TCP sender by reading kernel\-level
data exported by Web100 (see \fBhttp://www.web100.org\fP) on the server. In
addition, it estimates the round\-trip time in two ways: (1) by measuring
the time that connect() takes to complete (like \fBbittorrent\fP) and (2)
by measuring the average time elapsed between sending a small request
and received a small response.
.sp
The \fBspeedtest\fP test emulates HTTP to estimate the round\-trip
time, the download and the upload goodput. It estimates the round\-trip
time in two ways: (1) by measuring the time that connect() takes
to complete (like \fBbittorrent\fP) and (2) by measuring the average
time elapsed between sending a small request and received a small
response (like \fBraw\fP). It estimates the goodput by dividing the
amount of transferred bytes by the elapsed time. To avoid consuming
too much user resources, the \fBbittorrent\fP test adapts the number
of bytes to transfer such that the test runs for about five seconds.
.sp
See the \fI\%WEB API\fP section for a description of the results saved
by all the experiments (see, in particular, the \fB/api/data\fP
description).

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBneubot database [\-f database] [action]\fP
Performs the specified \fBaction\fP or prints the database\(aqs path
if no action is specified.  We do not recommended to use this
command to modify the database while Neubot is running, since
Neubot\(aqs does not expect the database to change while it is
running, so it won\(aqt pick the changes up. This command requires
\fBroot\fP privileges to modify the database: if you are not
\fBroot\fP, the database is opened in readonly mode.
.sp
Accepts the following options:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-f \ database
Force file. Forces the command to use \fIdatabase\fP instead of the default
database path.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBneubot start\fP
On MacOS this command runs launchctl(1), which in turn starts
Neubot. You must be \fBroot\fP to run this command.  On MacOS, Neubot\(aqs
installer configures the system to launch Neubot at startup; i.e.,
you do not typically need to run this command.
.sp
(On MacOS, Neubot is implemented by two daemons: the usual unprivileged
daemon and a privileged daemon. The latter controls the former and
periodically forks an unprivileged child to check for updates.)
.sp
On MacOS, the start command accepts the following options:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a
Auto\-updates. When this flag is specified, the privileged
daemon periodically forks an unprivileged child to check
for updates.
.TP
.B \-d
Debug. When this flag is specified, Neubot runs in
the foreground.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose. When this flag is specified, the start command
is verbose (i.e., it prints on the standard error
the commands it is about to invoke).
.sp
When both \-v and \-d are specified, Neubot runs in verbose mode
in the foreground.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
At boot time, launchctl(1) starts Neubot with the \-a and \-d
command line options.
.sp
On other UNIX systems, the start command forks the Neubot daemon,
which drops \fBroot\fP privileges and runs in the background.  On such
systems, this command does not accept any command line option.
.TP
.B \fBneubot status\fP
This command asks the status of Neubot using the web API.  It
returns 0 if connect() succeeds and the response is OK, nonzero
otherwise.
.sp
On MacOS this command accepts the \fB\-v\fP option, which makes it
more verbose. On other UNIX systems, it does not accept any
command line option.
.TP
.B \fBneubot stop\fP
On MacOS, this command runs launchctl(1), which in turn stops
Neubot. You must be \fBroot\fP to run this command. On MacOS, this
command accepts the \fB\-v\fP option, which makes it more verbose.
.sp
On other UNIX systems, this command uses the web
API to request Neubot to exit.
.TP
.B \fBneubot viewer\fP
This command shows the web interface by embedding a web
rendering engine into a window manager\(aqs window. Currently,
the only implemented \fBviewer\fP is based on \fBpython\-webkit\fP
and \fBpygtk\fP.

.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBlang/\fP
Directory that contains one javascript file for each translation of
the web interface. Each of these javascripts contains a dictionary, named
\fBLANG\fP, that maps each string to its translation.
.sp
In javascript, you mark strings for translation by wrapping them
with \fBi18n.get()\fP calls. For example, to indicate that the string
"Disable automatic tests" should be translated, you should write:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\&...
i18n.get("Disable automatic tests");
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In HTML code, you mark HTML tags for translation by adding them to
the \fBi18n\fP class. In addition, you indicate the handle to be used
for translation by adding the selected tag to the \fBi18n_foo\fP
class. For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\&...
<p class="i18n i18n_foobar">Neubot web interface</p>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To translate the two examples above in, for example, Italian you
edit the \fBwww/lang/it.css\fP file and add:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
var LANG = {
    ...
    "Disable automatic tests": "Disabilita test automatici",

.sp
The Neubot project is a research effort that aims to study the quality
and neutrality of ordinary users\(aq Internet connections, to rebalance the
information asymmetry between them and Service Providers.  The Neubot
software (i) \fImeasures\fP the quality and neutrality of your Internet
connection.  The raw measurement results are (ii) \fIcollected\fP on the
measurement servers for research purposes and (iii) \fIpublished\fP, to allow
other individuals and institutions to reuse them for research purposes.
.sp
To \fImeasure\fP the quality and neutrality of your Internet connection,
the Neubot software does not monitor or analyze your Internet traffic.
It just uses a fraction of your connection capacity to perform background
transmission tests, sending and/or receiving random data.  The results
contain the measured performance metrics, such as the download speed,
or the latency, as well as your computer load, as a percentage, and
\fIyour Internet address\fP.
.sp
The Internet address is paramount because it allows to \fIinfer your Internet
Service Provider\fP and to have a rough idea of \fIyour location\fP, allowing to
put the results in context.  The Neubot project needs to \fIcollect\fP it
to study the data and wants to \fIpublish\fP it to enable other individuals
and institutions to carry alternative studies and/or peer\-review its
measurements and data analysis methodology.  This is coherent with the
policy of the distributed server platform that empowers the Neubot
project, Measurement Lab (M\-Lab), which requires all results to be
released as open data [1].
.sp
You are reading this privacy policy because Neubot is developed in the
European Union, where there is consensus that Internet addresses are
\fIpersonal data\fP.  This means that the Neubot project cannot store, process
or publish your address without your prior \fIinformed consent\fP, under the
provisions of the "Codice in materia di protezione dei dati personali"
(Decree 196/03) [2].  In accordance with the law, data controller is the
NEXA Center for Internet & Society [3], represented by its co\-director Juan
Carlos De Martin.
.sp
Via its web interface [4], the Neubot software asks you (a) to explicitly
assert that you are \fIinformed\fP, i.e. that you have read the privacy
policy, (b) to give it the permission to \fIcollect\fP and (c) \fIpublish\fP your
IP address.  If you do not assert (a) and you don\(aqt give the permission
to do (b) and (c), Neubot cannot run tests because, if it did, it would
violate privacy laws and/or Measurement Lab policy.
.sp
The data controller guarantees you the rights as per Art. 7 of the
above\-mentioned Decree 196/03.  Basically, you have total control over
you personal data, and you can, for example, inquire Neubot to remove
your Internet address from its data sets.  To exercise your rights, please
write to <\fI\%privacy@neubot.org\fP> or to "NEXA Center for Internet & Society,
Dipartimento di Automatica e Infomatica, Politecnico di Torino, Corso Duca
degli Abruzzi 24, 10129 Turin, ITALY."
