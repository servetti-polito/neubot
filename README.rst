Neubot Dash: testing HTTP streaming network neutrality
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````

This is a fork of the neubot project that adds a new test for the DASH
protocol. The test will be performed against the server hosted on
streaming.polito.it.

At this moment, only the development branch is up to date, no release has been
made. You can clone the development version with this command:

    git clone -b develop https://github.com/servetti-polito/neubot-dash.git

The DASH test can be run from the command line:

    python ./bin/neubot dash -fv -A streaming.polito.it
