           Speedtest is a test that sheds some light on the quality
           of your broadband connection, by downloading/uploading random data
           to/from a remote server, and reporting the average speeds.  The
           test also yields an over-estimate of the round-trip latency between
           you and such remote server.  To better understand what the test
           measures, please see the relevant
<a href="http://www.neubot.org/faq#what-does-measuring-goodput-mean">FAQ
           entry</a>.

          <p class="i18n i18n_results_speedtest_explanation_2">
           Neubot results are correlated with the quality of your
           broadband connection (and with other confounding factors,
           as explained in the
<a href="http://www.neubot.org/faq#what-does-measuring-goodput-mean">FAQ</a>).
           So, to put them in the context of the
           average broadband speed available in your country you
           might want to check the statistics available at the <a
           href="http://www.oecd.org/sti/ict/broadband">OECD Broadband
           Portal</a>.  In particular, it might be interesting to read <a
