           This tests downloads and uploads a given number of bytes from
           a remote server using the BitTorrent protocol.  It reports the
           average download and upload speed measured during the test as
           well as the time required to connect to the remote server,
           which approximates the round-trip time latency.  To better
           understand what the test measures, please see the relevant

           Please, note that this test is quite different from the speedtest
           one, so there are cases where the comparison between the two is not
           feasible.  We're working to deploy an HTTP test that mimics the
           behavior of this one, so that it's always possible to compare them.
