    <p>The `raw` test is a test that characterizes your Internet connection
       by estimating round-trip latency at application level and by measuring
       the download goodput.  Instead of targeting a single Neubot server,
       this test selects a random server each time (so the goodput is expected
       to oscillate with the round-trip latency).  The test does not emulate
       any protocol, and just sends random data, but takes download goodput
       snapshots during the test, as well as process load information and TCP
       statistics.  The plan is to use this test's results to study certain
       TCP properties that may lead to a better understanding of network
       neutrality.  For sure, we aim to backport innovations introduced by
       this test to the other transmission tests.</p>

    <p>Please, note that the web user interface is unfortunately not yet ready
       to show goodput and TCP snapshots collected by this test.  We decided
       to deploy the test core in this release, even if the web interface
       integration was not finished, to start studying this test results, in
       order to identify the best parameters to show.</p>
